The `NgxFwBaseContent` interface is the foundation for all form controls and groups. It defines a common set of options that control registration, validation, visibility, and behavior of the form elements.

| Name            | Type                | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                            |
|-----------------|---------------------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| type            | `string`            | Yes      | Specifies the kind of form control. Determines what control is used and what additional properties are available.                                                      |
| id              | `string`            | Yes      | Unique identifier for the control. Used to link configuration with runtime behavior and maintain state consistency.<br/>This is also used and the controls name.       |
| validators      | `string[]`          | No       | Array of strings representing names of synchronous validators that apply to the control. These can be registered globally with a validator registration object.        |
| asyncValidators | `string[]`          | No       | Similar to validators, but for asynchronous validation logic that may involve API calls or other deferred operations.                                                  |
| hidden          | `string`            | No       | A string expression that determines when the control should be hidden. This condition is evaluated at runtime against the whole form object.                           |
| hideStrategy    | `HideStrategy`      | No       | Specifies how to handle the control when hidden: 'keep' (remains in form model) or 'remove' (removed from form model).                                                 |
| valueStrategy   | `ValueStrategy`     | No       | Determines how the control's value is handled when visibility changes: 'last' (preserves last value), 'default' (reverts to default value), or 'reset' (clears value). |
| disabled        | `string \| boolean` | No       | Defines whether the control should be disabled. Can be a boolean value or a string expression that evaluates against the form object.                                  |
| readonly        | `string \| boolean` | No       | Indicates if the control is read-only (displayed but not modifiable). Accepts either a boolean value or a string expression for dynamic evaluation.                    |
| updateOn        | `UpdateStrategy`    | No       | Specifies when to update the control's value: 'change' (as user types, default), 'blur' (when control loses focus), or 'submit' (when form is submitted).              |
