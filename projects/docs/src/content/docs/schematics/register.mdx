import ResolvingOptions from '../../shared/resolving-options.md';

While the [Generator Schematics](/schematics/generators/), per default, already register every new component, you may not always use them. In those cases you could either manually register them or use this schematic.

## What does it do

This schematic tries to find all relevant controls and registers them at the appropriate place. It does **not** discover validators. Those always have to be manually registered.

## Options

## Setting Options

There are two ways to set custom default options. This helps repeating the same parameters on every CLi command.

### In `formwork.config.json`

All options are optional, but are listed here in full. You can put any combination of them.

```json title="formwork.config.json"
{
  "registrationType": "map",
  "controlRegistrationsPath": "app/form/registrations.ts",
  "discovery": {
    "include": ["**/components/form/controls/**"],
    "exclude": ["**/components/form/controls/secret/**"]
  }
}
```

### In `angular.json`

You can set default values for any ngx-formwork schematic option in your `angular.json`. Add a `schematics` section under your project with the schematic name and desired defaults.

All options are optional, but are listed here in full. You can put any combination of them.
Note, that compared to `formwork.config.json`, you have to repeat all values.

```json title="angular.json"
{
  "projects": {
    "my-app": {
      "schematics": {
        "ngx-formwork:register": {
          "registrationType": "map",
          "controlRegistrationsPath": "app/form/registrations.ts",
          "include": ["**/components/form/controls/**"],
          "exclude": ["**/components/form/controls/secret/**"]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
